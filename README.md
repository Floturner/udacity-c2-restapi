### Installing project dependencies

This project uses NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM Relies on the package.json file located in the root of this repository. After cloning, open your terminal and run:
```bash
npm install
```
>_tip_: **npm i** is shorthand for **npm install**

## Running the Server Locally
To run the server locally in developer mode, open terminal and run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Developer mode runs off the TypeScript source. Any saves will reset the server and run the latest version of the codebase.
